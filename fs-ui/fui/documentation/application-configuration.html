            <h2>⚙️ Understanding Application Configuration</h2>
            
            <h3>What is Application Configuration?</h3>
            <p>Application configuration settings allow your organization to customize the system to match your business processes, terminology, and workflow requirements. These settings control dropdown values, field visibility, feature availability, and default behaviors across different modules.</p>

            <h3>How Configuration Works</h3>
            <p>The system uses a hierarchical configuration structure:</p>
            
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h4>Organization Level</h4>
                    <p>Root-level settings that apply to the entire organization</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h4>Module Level</h4>
                    <p>Settings specific to each module (HRMS, Project, Sales, etc.)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h4>Team Level</h4>
                    <p>Settings that can be customized for specific teams (if enabled)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h4>User Level</h4>
                    <p>Personal preferences and settings for individual users</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Configuration Types</h3>
            <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Dropdown Lists:</strong> Predefined values that appear in selection fields (e.g., employee bands, project categories)</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Toggles:</strong> Enable or disable specific features and functionalities</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Level Hierarchies:</strong> Complex nested structures (e.g., Service Line → Delivery Category → Task Category)</li>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Enable Single Service Line Selection</strong>
                <p>Controls whether projects can have only one service line selected, or multiple service lines.</p>
                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> When creating or editing projects, you can select only one service line. This simplifies project setup and ensures projects are focused on a single service area.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> Projects can have multiple service lines, allowing for more complex projects that span multiple service areas.</p>

        <section id="configuration-management" class="section">
            <h2>🔧 Configuration Management</h2>
            
            <h3>Understanding Configuration States</h3>
            
            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Locked Configuration</strong>
                <p>A locked configuration cannot be modified at the current level. It inherits its value from a parent level (organization, team, etc.).</p>
                <p><strong>When Locked:</strong> The configuration value is read-only and cannot be changed. You must modify it at the parent level if changes are needed.</p>
                <p><strong>When Unlocked:</strong> The configuration can be customized at the current level, allowing for level-specific customization.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Hidden Configuration</strong>
                <p>A hidden configuration is not visible in the user interface, even though it may have a value.</p>
                <p><strong>When Hidden:</strong> The configuration field does not appear in forms or settings pages. Users cannot see or interact with it.</p>
                <p><strong>When Visible:</strong> The configuration appears in the interface and can be viewed and modified (if not locked).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Overridden Configuration</strong>
                <p>An overridden configuration has been customized at the current level, overriding the parent value.</p>
                <p><strong>When Overridden:</strong> The current level has its own value that differs from the parent. This allows for level-specific customization.</p>
                <p><strong>When Not Overridden:</strong> The configuration uses the parent value. Changes at the parent level will affect this level.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Configuration Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>Configuration settings follow a hierarchy:</p>
            <ol style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Organization Level (Root):</strong> Default values that apply to the entire organization</li>
                <li><strong>Team Level:</strong> Values that can override organization defaults for specific teams</li>
                <li><strong>User Level:</strong> Personal preferences that can override team or organization defaults</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="tip">
                <strong>💡 Tip:</strong> When a configuration is locked, it means the value is inherited from a parent level. To change it, you need to modify it at the parent level or unlock it at the current level.
            </div>

            <h3>Multi-Level Configurations</h3>
            <p>Some configurations use multi-level hierarchies (e.g., Service Line → Delivery Category → Task Category). These allow for:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li>Detailed categorization and organization</li>
                <li>Hierarchical reporting and filtering</li>
                <li>Flexible structure that can be expanded as needed</li>
                <li>Consistent data organization across the system</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>📌 Note:</strong> Configuration changes may affect how you interact with the system. If you notice missing options or unexpected behavior after a configuration update, contact your system administrator.
