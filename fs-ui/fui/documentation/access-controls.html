            <h2>🔐 Understanding Access Controls</h2>
            
            <h3>What are Access Controls?</h3>
            <p>Access controls determine what features and functions you can use in the system. They are configured by your system administrator based on your role and responsibilities.</p>

            <h3>How Access Controls Work</h3>
            <p>The system uses a multi-level access control system:</p>
            
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h4>Module-Level</h4>
                    <p>Controls access to entire modules (HRMS, Sales, Project)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h4>Feature-Level</h4>
                    <p>Controls access to specific features within modules</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h4>Action-Level</h4>
                    <p>Controls what actions you can perform (Create, Edit, Delete, View)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h4>Data-Level</h4>
                    <p>Controls which data you can see (your team only, all teams, etc.)</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Why You Might Not See Features</h3>
            <p>If you don't see a button, menu item, or feature, it's likely because:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li>Your role doesn't have permission for that feature</li>
                <li>The feature is disabled for your organization</li>
                <li>You need to be assigned to a specific team</li>
                <li>The feature requires additional configuration</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>📌 Note:</strong> Access controls are set by your system administrator. If you need access to a feature, contact your administrator or team lead.
            </div>

            <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li>The module won't appear in the left sidebar menu</li>
                <li>You cannot access any features within that module</li>
                <li>Direct URLs to module pages will redirect or show access denied</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="tip">
                <strong>💡 Tip:</strong> Your default landing page after login depends on which modules you have access to. The system redirects you to your default module dashboard.

                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Create Projects</strong></td>
                        <td>Allows you to create new projects. When enabled, you'll see the "Create Project" button and can access the project creation form. This permission is essential for project managers and team leads who need to initiate new work.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Edit Projects</strong></td>
                        <td>Allows you to modify existing project information including dates, team assignments, descriptions, and other project fields. When enabled, you'll see edit buttons and can update project details. Some fields may still be restricted based on project status or other settings.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Duplicate Projects</strong></td>
                        <td>Allows you to create copies of existing projects with all their settings and configurations. This is useful when starting similar projects or creating project templates. The duplicated project will have a new name and ID but retain original settings.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Delete Projects</strong></td>
                        <td>Allows you to mark projects as deleted. Deleted projects are typically hidden from normal views but can be restored if needed. This is different from permanent removal - deleted projects retain their data for recovery purposes.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Permanently Remove Projects</strong></td>
                        <td>Allows you to permanently delete projects from the system. This action cannot be undone and removes all project data including tasks, work items, and history. This permission is typically restricted to administrators only.</td>

                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Archive Projects</strong></td>
                        <td>Allows you to archive completed or inactive projects. Archived projects are moved out of active views but remain accessible for historical reference. You can also unarchive projects if needed. Archiving helps keep active project lists clean while preserving data.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>View Projects</strong></td>
                        <td>Allows you to see project details and information. This is the most basic permission - without it, you cannot access any project information. Even with view permission, you may only see projects from teams you have access to.</td>

                </tbody>

            <h3>Team-Based Access Controls</h3>
            
            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Switch Between Teams</strong>
                <p>Controls whether you can change which team's projects you're viewing using the team filter dropdown.</p>
                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> You can use the team dropdown filter to switch between different teams and view their projects. This is useful for managers who oversee multiple teams or need cross-team visibility.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> You can only see projects from teams you're directly assigned to. The team filter may be hidden or disabled, restricting you to your own team's projects only.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Typically enabled for managers, administrators, and cross-functional roles. Disabled for individual contributors who should focus on their own team's work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Show Only Current Team Projects</strong>
                <p>Restricts the project list to display only projects belonging to your currently selected team, even if you have access to multiple teams.</p>
                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> The project list automatically filters to show only projects from your current team. You won't see projects from other teams you have access to unless you explicitly switch teams (if team switching is enabled).</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> You can see projects from all teams you have access to in a single unified list, making it easier to view cross-team projects.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Useful for organizations that want to maintain team boundaries and reduce information overload. Disabled when cross-team collaboration is encouraged.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Access Other Teams' Projects</strong>
                <p>Controls whether you can view and interact with projects that belong to teams other than your own.</p>
                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> You can open, view details, and potentially edit projects from other teams (depending on your other permissions). This enables cross-team collaboration and visibility.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> You can only access projects from your own team. Attempting to access other teams' projects will result in an access denied message or the project won't appear in your views.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Enabled for collaborative environments where teams need to see each other's work. Disabled for strict team isolation or when data confidentiality requires team boundaries.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Show Only Active Teams When Creating Projects</strong>
                <p>Controls which teams appear in the team selection dropdown when creating a new project.</p>
                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> Only teams that are currently active appear in the dropdown. Inactive or archived teams are hidden, preventing assignment of projects to inactive teams.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> All teams (both active and inactive) may appear in the dropdown, allowing assignment to any team.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Typically enabled to prevent accidental assignment to inactive teams and maintain data integrity. Ensures projects are only created for active, functioning teams.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Show All Teams in Project Creation</strong>
                <p>Controls whether you can select teams you're not assigned to when creating projects.</p>
                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> When creating a project, you can select any team from the dropdown, even if you're not a member of that team. This allows project managers to create projects for any team.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> You can only select teams you're assigned to when creating projects, ensuring projects are created within your own team structure.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Enabled for project managers and administrators who need to create projects across the organization. Disabled to maintain team boundaries and prevent cross-team project creation.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Status Management Controls</h3>
            
            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Change Project Status</strong>
                <p>Controls whether you can modify a project's status (e.g., from Active to Completed, or from In Progress to On Hold).</p>
                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> You can change project status using status dropdowns or status change buttons. This allows you to track project progress and update project state as work progresses.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> Project status is locked and cannot be changed. Only users with status change permission can update it. This prevents unauthorized status changes and maintains workflow integrity.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Typically enabled for project managers and team leads who need to track project progress. May be disabled for team members to prevent accidental status changes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Move Status Backwards</strong>
                <p>Controls whether you can change a project's status to a previous state (e.g., moving from "Completed" back to "In Progress" or from "In Progress" back to "Planned").</p>
                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> You can move project status backwards in the workflow. This is useful when a project needs to be reopened, work needs to be redone, or status was changed incorrectly.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> You can only move status forward (e.g., Planned → In Progress → Completed). Once a status is reached, you cannot go back, maintaining a forward-only workflow.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Disabled for strict workflows where status progression should be one-way. Enabled when flexibility is needed to correct mistakes or handle project changes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Allowed Status Changes</strong>
                <p>Defines which specific statuses you can change a project to, even if status changes are generally allowed.</p>
                <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> This creates a whitelist of statuses you can select. For example, you might be able to change status to "In Progress" or "On Hold" but not to "Completed" (which might require approval).</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A team member might be able to change status to "In Progress" or "Blocked" but cannot mark a project as "Completed" - only project managers can do that.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Used to implement role-based status workflows where different roles can only move projects to certain statuses, ensuring proper approval processes and workflow control.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Time-Based Restrictions</h3>
            
            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Delete Work Items Until Next Day (Time Limit)</strong>
                <p>Controls how long after creating a work item you can delete it. This creates a time window (e.g., until 10 AM the next day) during which work items can be deleted.</p>
                <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> After the specified time limit passes, work items become permanent and cannot be deleted. This prevents accidental deletion of important time entries while still allowing corrections shortly after entry.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If set to "10 AM next day", you can delete a work item entered on Monday until 10 AM on Tuesday. After that, it's locked.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Prevents deletion of historical time entries while allowing quick corrections for recent mistakes. Helps maintain accurate time records and billing data.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Edit Hours on Completed Work Items (Time Limit)</strong>
                <p>Controls how long after completing a work item you can still edit its hours. This creates a time window (e.g., until 10 AM the next day) during which hours can be modified.</p>
                <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> After the specified time limit passes, hours on completed work items become locked and cannot be changed. This prevents retroactive hour modifications while allowing corrections shortly after completion.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If set to "10 AM next day", you can edit hours on a work item completed on Monday until 10 AM on Tuesday.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Balances the need for error correction with the need to maintain historical data integrity. Prevents changes to old time entries that could affect billing or reporting.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Other Work Item Controls</h3>
            
            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Prevent Creating Work Items Before Y Working Days If X Hours Already Logged</strong>
                <p>Controls whether you can create work items for dates that are Y working days in the past if you've already logged X hours for that date.</p>
                <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> This creates a combined restriction that considers both the date and hours already logged. For example, if set to "5 working days" and "8 hours", you cannot create additional work items for dates more than 5 days ago if you've already logged 8 hours for that date.</p>
                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> Prevents adding more work items to old dates that already have significant hours logged, reducing the likelihood of errors or duplicate entries.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> You can create work items for any date regardless of hours already logged.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Enabled to prevent retroactive changes to dates that already have substantial time logged, maintaining data integrity and preventing accidental over-logging.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Allow Creating Work Items with Completed Status</strong>
                <p>Controls whether you can create work items that are immediately marked as completed, rather than starting in an "In Progress" or "Pending" status.</p>
                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> You can create work items and mark them as completed in one step. This is useful for quick entries of work that has already been finished.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> New work items must be created in a non-completed status and then moved to completed separately. This enforces a workflow where work items progress through statuses.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Enabled for quick time entry of completed work. Disabled to enforce status workflows and ensure proper tracking of work item progression.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Maximum Hours Allowed Per Work Item</strong>
                <p>Controls the maximum number of hours you can enter in a single work item entry.</p>
                <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> When creating or editing a work item, you cannot enter more than the specified maximum hours (e.g., 24 hours). This prevents unrealistic hour entries and helps catch data entry errors.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If set to 24 hours, you cannot log more than 24 hours in a single work item, even if you worked longer. You would need to create multiple work items or split the time across multiple entries.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Prevents data entry errors and unrealistic hour entries. Typically set to 24 hours to allow full-day entries while preventing mistakes like entering 240 hours instead of 24.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Restrict Work Item Creation Based on Employee Skills</strong>
                <p>Controls whether you can only create work items for projects or tasks that match your assigned skills.</p>
                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> When creating work items, you can only select projects or tasks that require skills you have been assigned. Projects/tasks that don't match your skills are hidden from selection. This ensures work items are only created for work you're qualified to perform.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> You can create work items for any project or task regardless of your skills. All available projects and tasks appear in selection dropdowns.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Enabled to ensure proper skill matching and prevent assignment of work to unqualified team members.

                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Enabled to allow planning and familiarization with upcoming timesheet periods. Disabled to restrict access to only relevant (current and past) timesheet periods.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Enable Viewing Past Timesheets</strong>
                <p>Controls whether you can view and access timesheet pages for past dates.</p>
                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> You can navigate to and view timesheet pages for previous weeks or months. This allows you to review historical time entries and access past timesheet data.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> Past timesheet pages are not accessible. You can only view current timesheets, preventing access to historical data.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Typically enabled to allow review of historical time entries and access to past timesheet data. Disabled in rare cases where historical data access should be restricted.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Time Entry Restrictions</h3>
            
            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Maximum Hours Allowed Per Day</strong>
                <p>Controls the maximum number of hours you can enter per day in your timesheet.</p>
                <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> When entering time for a specific date, you cannot log more than the specified maximum hours (e.g., 24 hours). This prevents unrealistic daily hour entries and helps catch data entry errors.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If set to 24 hours, you cannot log more than 24 hours total for a single day across all work items, even if you worked longer. You would need to split the time across multiple days or contact an administrator.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Prevents data entry errors and unrealistic daily hour entries. Typically set to 24 hours to allow full-day entries while preventing mistakes. May be set lower (e.g., 12 hours) for organizations with strict work-hour policies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Disable Editing Last Month's Timesheet After X Days</strong>
                <p>Controls how long into the current month you can still edit timesheet entries from the previous month.</p>
                <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> After X days into the current month, timesheet entries from the previous month become locked and cannot be edited. This creates a deadline for timesheet corrections and ensures timely closure of monthly timesheets.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If set to 5 days, you can edit last month's timesheet entries until the 5th day of the current month. After that, last month's entries are locked and require administrator approval to modify.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Ensures timesheets are finalized in a timely manner and prevents ongoing changes to historical data. Helps maintain accurate monthly records for payroll and billing. Typically set to 3-7 days to allow reasonable correction periods while ensuring timely closure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Prevent Creating Work Items Before Y Working Days If X Hours Already Logged</strong>
                <p>Controls whether you can create work items for dates that are Y working days in the past if you've already logged X hours for that date.</p>
                <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> This creates a combined restriction that considers both the date and hours already logged. For example, if set to "5 working days" and "8 hours", you cannot create additional work items for dates more than 5 days ago if you've already logged 8 hours for that date.</p>
                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> Prevents adding more work items to old dates that already have significant hours logged, reducing the likelihood of errors or duplicate entries.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> You can create work items for any date regardless of hours already logged.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Enabled to prevent retroactive changes to dates that already have substantial time logged, maintaining data integrity and preventing accidental over-logging.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Project Restrictions</h3>
            <p>Timesheet entries follow the same project and non-project work item date restrictions as described in the Work Item Access Controls section. These restrictions control when you can create work items for projects vs. non-project activities.</p>

            <h3>Team and Employee Controls</h3>
            
            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Switch Between Teams When Viewing Timesheets</strong>

                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> You can use the team dropdown filter to switch between different teams and view their timesheets. This is useful for managers who oversee multiple teams or need cross-team visibility.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> You can only see timesheets from teams you're directly assigned to. The team filter may be hidden or disabled, restricting you to your own team's timesheets only.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Typically enabled for managers, administrators, and cross-functional roles. Disabled for individual contributors who should focus on their own team's timesheets.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Switch Between Employees When Viewing Timesheets</strong>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Restrict Project Selection Based on Employee Skills</strong>
                <p>Controls whether you can only select projects that match your assigned skills when creating timesheet entries.</p>
                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> When creating timesheet entries, you can only select projects that require skills you have been assigned. Projects that don't match your skills are hidden from selection. This ensures timesheet entries are only created for work you're qualified to perform.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> You can create timesheet entries for any project regardless of your skills. All available projects appear in selection dropdowns.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Enabled to ensure proper skill matching and prevent assignment of work to unqualified team members. Helps maintain quality and ensures work is logged against appropriate projects. Disabled when skill matching is not required or when flexibility is needed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Show Only Current Team Projects in Timesheet</strong>

                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> Only projects from your currently selected team appear in the project dropdown. Projects from other teams are hidden, even if you have access to them. This simplifies project selection and maintains team boundaries.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> All projects you have access to appear in the dropdown, regardless of team. This allows you to log time against projects from multiple teams.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Enabled to maintain team boundaries and simplify project selection. Disabled when cross-team project work is common and team members need to log time against projects from multiple teams.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="field-description">
                <strong>Show All Accounts for Non-Billable Time Entry</strong>
                <p>Controls which accounts appear in the account selection dropdown when logging non-billable timesheet entries.</p>
                <p><strong>When Enabled:</strong> All accounts in the system appear in the dropdown when logging non-billable time, not just accounts associated with your projects. This allows you to log administrative time, training, or other non-billable activities against any account.</p>
                <p><strong>When Disabled:</strong> Only accounts from your assigned projects appear in the dropdown. This restricts non-billable time logging to accounts you're already associated with.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Enabled when non-billable time needs to be tracked against various accounts (e.g., internal projects, training accounts, administrative accounts). Disabled to maintain account boundaries and ensure non-billable time is only logged against relevant accounts.</p>
